The launch of XSGD and AUDD on Base is more than a technical upgrade—it’s a cultural shift. The X thread following the announcement (e.g., posts from @xoAntheezy
 and @HungryDegens
) reflects community excitement, with users celebrating Base’s inclusivity (“Base is for everyone”) and its growing meme coin and NFT culture. The integration also complements recent developments, such as the July 2025 Base Ecosystem Fund grants, which have fueled projects like BankrBot, an AI trading agent thriving on Base.Economic PotentialWith Asia-Pacific accounting for 30% of global crypto adoption (per a 2025 Crypto.com report), XSGD and AUDD could drive significant TVL growth on Base. Analysts predict that localized stablecoins could capture 15-20% of the region’s $500 billion crypto market by 2027, with Base well-positioned to lead this charge.Challenges AheadDespite the optimism, challenges remain. Base’s reliance on a centralized sequencer, as seen in the August outage, raises concerns about decentralization. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins in Singapore and Australia could evolve, potentially impacting XSGD and AUDD’s operations. Base will need to address these issues to maintain its momentum.
