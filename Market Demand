The timing of this launch is no coincidence. In 2024, stablecoin transaction volume globally exceeded $30 trillion, according to Chainalysis, with a growing demand for alternatives to USD-dominated stablecoins like USDC and USDT. An Ipsos survey commissioned by Coinbase in 2025 revealed that over 70% of crypto users in Singapore and Australia prefer stablecoins tied to their local currencies, citing trust and reduced exchange rate risks. XSGD and AUDD directly address this need, positioning Base as a leader in localized financial solutions.
