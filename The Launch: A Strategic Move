The announcement post on X featured an image with XSGD (in red) and AUDD (in blue) encircled by their national silhouettes, symbolizing a union of regional currencies on a unified blockchain. The text, “Bringing the world onchain means bringing every currency onchain. Today’s a step forward:  XSGD and  AUDD are now live on Base,” reflects Base’s vision of inclusivity. This launch follows Coinbase’s September 24, 2025, decision to list XSGD and AUDD globally, signaling a strategic pivot toward localized stablecoins to drive crypto adoption.
