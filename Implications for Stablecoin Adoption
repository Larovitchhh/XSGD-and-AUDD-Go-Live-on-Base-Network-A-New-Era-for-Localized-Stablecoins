Enhanced AccessibilityBy bringing XSGD and AUDD to Base, users in Singapore and Australia can now transact in their native currencies without converting to USD, simplifying onboarding for new crypto users. This is particularly impactful in Southeast Asia and Oceania, where remittances and e-commerce are booming. For instance, a Singaporean user can pay a freelancer in XSGD via a Base-integrated dApp, avoiding costly SWIFT fees and delays.DeFi and Programmable FinanceThe programmable nature of XSGD and AUDD opens doors for DeFi innovation on Base. Developers can integrate these stablecoins into lending protocols, yield farming, or tokenized asset settlements, leveraging Base’s low fees to attract users. This aligns with Base’s recent partnerships with projects like Morpho, which has locked $1.5 billion in lending pools, signaling a fertile ground for growth.Regulatory ComplianceBoth XSGD and AUDD are regulated entities, with XSGD pre-compliant with Singapore’s stablecoin framework and AUDD supported by Australia’s central bank initiatives. This regulatory backing reduces the risk of delistings or sanctions that have plagued other stablecoins, offering Base users a safer investment vehicle.
