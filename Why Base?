Base’s low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure makes it an ideal platform for scaling stablecoin usage. With transaction costs a fraction of Ethereum’s, users can transfer XSGD or AUDD for pennies, a critical factor for microtransactions and cross-border payments prevalent in Asia-Pacific markets. Additionally, Base’s integration with Coinbase’s infrastructure ensures seamless bridging from Ethereum-based USDC to native stablecoins, enhancing liquidity and accessibility.
