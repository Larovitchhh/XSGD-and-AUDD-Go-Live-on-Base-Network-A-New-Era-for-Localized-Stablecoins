Base, launched by Coinbase in 2023 as an optimistic rollup L2, has rapidly grown into a robust platform for decentralized applications. By processing transactions off-chain and settling them on Ethereum, Base achieves transaction fees as low as $0.001 and confirmation times under five seconds—far surpassing Ethereum mainnet’s current capabilities. As of October 2025, Base boasts a total value locked (TVL) of $4.2 billion, hosting a diverse ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and meme coin projects.The network’s developer-friendly environment, supported by the Base Ecosystem Fund, has attracted builders worldwide. Recent milestones, such as the integration of native USDC and a brief 29-minute sequencer outage in August 2025 (the first since launch), highlight both its resilience and areas for improvement. Base’s ethos of “empowering without extracting” aligns with its decision to onboard XSGD and AUDD, enhancing its appeal as a global hub for financial innovation.
