Looking forward, Base’s roadmap includes expanding support for additional regional stablecoins, potentially including the Thai Baht or Indonesian Rupiah, as hinted by Coinbase executives in recent interviews. The network’s ongoing upgrades, such as improved sequencer decentralization and cross-chain bridges, will further enhance XSGD and AUDD’s utility. For users, this means more options to engage with a global economy—whether through remittances, DeFi, or NFT purchases—all at the click of a button.
